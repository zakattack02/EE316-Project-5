Welcome to the repository for Design Project 5 of the EE 316 Computer Engineering Junior Lab for Spring 2024. This project involves the development of a digital system using the Xilinx ZynQ processor. Below you will find all the necessary information, specifications, parts list, and guidelines for the project.

## Specification
- **Digital System**: A digital system using Xilinx ZynQ processor.
- **Due Date**: Thursday, April 9 (Project Submission), Friday, April 11 (Written Report Submission).
- **Parts List**:
  1. Digilent Cora-Z7-07S
  2. PMOD buttons and LEDs
  3. Arduino Starter Kit components:
     - Photoresistor(s)
     - Potentiometer
     - Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SC04)
     - Servo Motor (SG90)
     - DC motor
     - Passive buzzer
     - LCD module (I2C)
     - 3.3/5V Power Supply

## Project Description
Develop a digital system capable of sampling 8-bit data from any available analog inputs on Digilentâ€™s Cora Z7 on the Analog header. The system will then control the angular position of a servo motor, the intensity of PMOD LEDs, and the speed of a DC motor.

## Design Specifications
- Utilize Digilentinc's Cora-Z7 board, Xilinx's Vivado, and SDK tools for design.
- Use Xilinx's Zynq processor and other IPs for system design, pin assignment, bitstream generation, and export to Xilinx SDK.
- Control servo motor and PMOD LEDs with potentiometer.
- Control servo motor rotation (-90 to +90 degrees) using PWM signal.
- Control PMOD LEDs' intensity using AXI Timer's PWM output.
- Use light-sensitive resistor to control DC motor and buzzer.
- Use onboard buttons with interrupts for system control.
- Display system status and analog source on LCD.
- Utilize ultrasonic sensor for object detection and alerts.
- Implement colored LED and sound alarm based on object distance.
- Debug design using logic analyzer.
- Conduct data transactions on selected bus for functionality demonstration.
